## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rainmeter v4.5 or newer.** Rainmeter can be installed by downloading the `.exe` file [from Rainmeter's official website.](https://www.rainmeter.net/)
- **JaxCore v40005.** JaxCore can be installed by downloading the `.rmskin` file from [JaxCore's official website.](https://jax-core.github.io/)

### Installation

Assuming you successfully downloaded and installed Rainmeter as well as JaxCore, you can now proceed to install Keystrokes by following the steps below.

1. Download and run the `.rmskin` file for **Keystrokes** from the official [JaxCore site](https://jax-core.github.io/) to install **Keystrokes**.
2. Leave the installation settings at their defaults and click Install.
3. When the installation is finished, a startup pop-up should appear. Follow through the pop-up to finish installing **Keystrokes**.

> **Note:**  If you find that the JaxCore option is red on the startup pop-up, please press the red button and Core will be installed automatically. Perchance this fails, you can manually install Core by downloading the `.rmskin` file from [JaxCore's official website.](https://jax-core.github.io/)

### Customization

Now that you've installed and configured Keystrokes, let's take a look at some of its customization options!

#### Layouts:

There are currently two layout presets available in Keystrokes. They are,
- **Movements :** Displays only the movement keys (W,A,S,D, and Spacebar) along with the mouse buttons and the accelerometer. 
- **Fullboard :** Displays your entire keyboard and the mouse accelerometer.

> **Note:** Mouse Buttons and Mouse Accelerometer can be toggled On or Off when using either preset.

#### Hotkeys:
Using hotkeys, you can toggle **Draggability** and **Visibility**. Simply follow the steps below to setup hotkeys for the aforementioned actions.

1. Open Core and head over to the **Modules** section.
2. Select **Keystrokes** from the list and proceed to the **General** tab.
3. Under **Hotkeys**, 
    - Click the `LWin K` text to set the hotkey for toggling **visibility** on or off. 
    - Click the `LWin O` text to set the hotkey for toggling **draggability** on or off.
4. Set the new hotkey and press **Confirm**.
5. Refresh **Keystrokes** by deactivating and activating again using the toggle on the bottom left.

> **Note:** Further customization can be done through the **Appearance** tab which also includes the **RBG Chroma** feature.
